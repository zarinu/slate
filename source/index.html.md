# Introduction

Welcome to the Internship Project API! You can use our API to access IP API endpoints, which can get information on users, posts, roles, and etc in our database.

We have language bindings just in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can't switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right
because there is only one language ^_^.

For use this API in your local environment follow these steps:

1. `git clone https://git.aminsoft.org/aminsoft/internship-projects/web-projects/project_1_heydari/backend.git`

2. `cd backend && php artisan serve`
